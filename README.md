# Hotel\_\_backend-task-client

This client side built using React.js for backend task in this [github gist](https://gist.github.com/ahmed3mar/483fa6bf1f5bdb8bf58f37fcd538d068)

I worked on it using plain PHP, can't forget great help by [Eng. Hoda Hussin](https://github.com/hodaa) mentoring me and reviewing my progress.

## About
